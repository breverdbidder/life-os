## 📌 NEXT DECISION POINT

**Question**: Which approach?
1. ⭐ **Option 3 (Sequential)**: BidDeed.AI first (7 months), then SPD (10 months) - **RECOMMENDED**
2. Option 1 (BidDeed.AI Only): Improve existing product only (7 months)
3. Option 2 (SPD Only): Enter TestFit market only (10 months)
4. Option 4 (Parallel): Both simultaneously (10 months, 2x capacity)

**If Option 3 (Sequential)**:
- Start BidDeed.AI Stage 8 (Generative Bid Strategy) next week
- Deploy Phase 1 by Month 2
- Start SPD Stage 4 (Generative Design) in Month 8
