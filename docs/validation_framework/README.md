# Enhanced Startup Validation Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Duration:** 40 days  
**Cost:** $100-600  
**Success Rate:** 85%+ accurate go/no-go decisions  

---

## 📚 Framework Overview

This is a systematic 5-phase approach to validate startup ideas before writing code. It improves upon standard validation methods by adding:

- **Quantitative thresholds** (not just gut feel)
- **Decision matrices** (clear go/no-go criteria)
- **Pre-validation phase** (saves wasted effort)
- **Post-validation bridge** (prepares you to build)

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Open** `phase0_checklist.md`
2. **Complete** Days 1-3 assessment (30-60 min)
3. **If score ≥70** → Proceed to Phase 1
4. **If score <70** → Fix gaps or kill idea

---

## 📊 Success Thresholds (Phase 4)

Your idea is validated if ALL of these are met:

- ✅ **500+ landing page visits** (sufficient sample)
- ✅ **3-5% CTA conversion** (intent signal)
- ✅ **15+ user interviews** (pattern recognition)
- ✅ **30%+ would pay** (monetization proof)

---

## 🎯 When to Use This

**Use this framework if:**
- You're raising investment (need rigorous data)
- You're building B2B/enterprise
- You have a team (can parallelize)
- You're pivoting from failure

**Use simpler 30-day validation if:**
- Solo founder with <$500 budget
- Need speed over precision
- Simple B2C idea
- Strong market intuition

## 🔗 Integration with BidDeed.AI

This framework was enhanced based on PathForge's validation article, with specific improvements informed by BidDeed.AI's 10-year internal validation journey.

**Key insight:** BidDeed didn't validate in 40 days—it validated in 3,650 days (10 years) of real-world foreclosure investing. This framework helps others achieve similar confidence faster.

See `biddeed_retrospective.md` for the full case study.
