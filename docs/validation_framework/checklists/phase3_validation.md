### The 5 Essential Questions

**1. "Tell me about the LAST TIME you faced [problem]"**
- Gets specific story (not hypothetical)
- Look for: frequency, context, emotions

**2. "What have you TRIED to solve this?"**
- Reveals current alternatives
- Uncovers willingness to experiment

**3. "What did that COST you (time/money)?"**
- Quantifies pain
- Validates budget exists

**4. "Walk me through your CURRENT WORKFLOW"**
- Maps jobs-to-be-done
- Identifies integration points

**5. "What would need to be TRUE for you to switch?"**
- Surfaces objections early
- Tests price sensitivity

### After Each Interview
- **Rate intensity (1-10):** How badly do they feel the pain?
- **Would pay? (Y/N):** Did they indicate budget?
- **Urgency (1-10):** How soon do they need a solution?

### Pattern Recognition (after 10 interviews)
- **Common objection:** ___________________________
- **Unexpected insight:** ___________________________  
- **Feature request (unprompted):** ___________________________
