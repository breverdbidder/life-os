# Distribution Playbook: 0 to 1000 Users

**Solution:** Tier-based playbook from first user to scale

```
Tier 1: Direct Outreach      (0 → 10 users)
        100% manual, high-touch

Tier 2: Community-Led        (10 → 100 users)
        Content + community

Tier 3: Scalable Channels    (100 → 1000+ users)
        Paid + organic systems

```

**Key Insight:** Don't skip tiers. Each teaches what you need for the next.

## 🚨 Common Distribution Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Paid Ads Too Early

**Don't run ads until:**
- You know your LTV
- You have product-market fit
- You can afford to burn $2K testing

**Why:** Ads are expensive, you'll waste money acquiring users who churn

### Mistake 2: SEO Without Search Volume

**Don't write content that:**
- Has <100 searches/month
- Targets the wrong intent (informational vs commercial)
- You can't rank for (too competitive)

**Do:** Keyword research FIRST, then write

### Mistake 3: Trying Everything at Once

**Don't:**
- Post on 10 platforms daily
- Run 5 ad campaigns simultaneously
- Write 20 blog posts/month

**Do:** Pick 1-2 channels, master them, then add more

### Mistake 4: No Clear CTA

**Every piece of content needs:**
- One clear call-to-action
- Easy next step
- Compelling reason to act now

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Retention

**Acquisition doesn't matter if:**
- Users don't activate (complete onboarding)
- Users don't return (retention <30%)
- Users churn immediately (bad product)

**Fix the product before scaling distribution**

## 🎓 Distribution Philosophy

**From Z.I.N.O.K:**
> "Distribution is not a separate phase - it starts Day 1. While building, start building audience."

**From BidDeed.AI:**
> "10 years of internal validation meant zero distribution muscle. Building in public from Day 1 would have created community + customers simultaneously."

**From Reviewer:**
> "The #1 reason products fail isn't bad product - it's no distribution. Plan distribution strategy in Validation Phase, not after building."

**Golden Rules:**
1. Start distributing before product is perfect
2. Focus on one channel until it works
3. Content + community compounds over time
4. Paid ads scale fast but require economics
5. Your first 10 users teach you how to get 1000
