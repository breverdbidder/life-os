# Partnership Scorecard: Structured Approach to Finding Co-Founders

**Problem:** Z.I.N.O.K's "Kfitza" phase was vague ("depends on energy and connections")  
**Solution:** Evidence-based partnership evaluation framework  

---

## 🎯 When Do You Need a Partner?

### Reasons to Stay Solo
- ✅ MVP can be built with vibe-coding (Loveable + Cursor)
- ✅ You have all necessary skills (tech + marketing + sales)
- ✅ You prefer autonomy and speed
- ✅ Small market opportunity (<$10M ARR potential)
- ✅ Lifestyle business goal (not exit-focused)

### Reasons to Find Partner(s)
- ✅ Technical product needs deep expertise you lack
- ✅ Market requires sales muscle you don't have
- ✅ Capital requirement exceeds your ability (>$50K)
- ✅ Large opportunity needs team execution (>$100M TAM)
- ✅ Complementary skills create unfair advantage

**Rule:** Only partner if 1+1 = 3+ (synergy, not division of labor)

## 🎯 Evaluating Potential Partners

### Part 1: Quantitative Scorecard (50 points)

Score each candidate out of 10, then total:

**1. Complementary Skills (__/10)**
- [ ] Covers your biggest skill gap completely (10 pts)

- [ ] Well-connected in relevant industry
- [ ] Has distribution channels

**3. Execution Speed (__/10)**
- [ ] Ships fast (can show recent projects) (10 pts)
- [ ] Doesn't need perfect plan to start

- [ ] Makes decisions quickly

**4. Financial Contribution (__/10)**
- [ ] Can contribute $10K+ capital (10 pts)
- [ ] Or has runway for 12+ months

---

### Part 2: Qualitative Assessment

#### 🚩 Red Flags (Any 1 = Disqualify)

- [ ] **"Ideas person" syndrome:** Lots of ideas, no execution
- [ ] **Equity disconnect:** Wants 50/50 but contributes 20% effort
- [ ] **No skin in game:** Won't invest time or money
- [ ] **Different risk tolerance:** You're all-in, they're side project
- [ ] **Unclear role boundaries:** "We'll figure it out"
- [ ] **Bad reputation:** Check references, past partners
- [ ] **Communication issues:** Hard to reach, unclear, defensive
- [ ] **No urgency:** "Let's take our time" attitude
- [ ] **Portfolio of unfinished projects:** Serial starter, never finisher
- [ ] **Wants salary immediately:** Before revenue/funding

#### ✅ Green Flags (Need 3+ for Strong Candidate)

- [ ] **Has done it before:** Built and shipped products
- [ ] **Unfair advantage:** Unique access or skill
- [ ] **Complements weaknesses:** Fills your gaps perfectly
- [ ] **Shares timeline:** Also wants to move fast
- [ ] **Independent validation:** Others vouch for them
- [ ] **Takes initiative:** Already building/contributing
- [ ] **Asks smart questions:** About market, customers, metrics
- [ ] **Has runway:** Not desperate for income
- [ ] **Challenges you:** Respectfully disagrees when needed
- [ ] **Clear track record:** Can verify claims

## 💰 Equity Framework

### The Problem with 50/50

**Why 50/50 often fails:**
- Creates deadlock in decisions
- Assumes equal contribution (rarely true)
- Ignores different risk levels
- Doesn't account for idea origination
- Prevents future fundraising (who's CEO?)

### Evidence-Based Equity Split

**5-Factor Framework:**

**1. Idea (5-10%)**
- Originated concept: 10%
- Identified market opportunity: 5%
- Neither (joined existing): 0%

**2. Execution (25-35%)**
- Will be full-time from day 1: 35%
- Full-time after validation: 25%
- Part-time (<20 hours/week): 15%

**3. Capital (20-30%)**
- Investing $50K+: 30%
- Investing $20-50K: 20%
- Investing $5-20K: 10%
- No investment: 0%

**4. Risk (15-25%)**
- Quit job, no runway: 25%
- Quit job, has runway: 20%
- Side project while employed: 10%
- Consulting on side: 5%

**5. Domain Expertise (15-25%)**
- Deep expertise (10+ years): 25%
- Moderate expertise (5-10 years): 15%
- Learning on job: 5%
- No relevant experience: 0%

**Total: 100%**

### Example Calculations

**Scenario 1: Solo technical founder bringing in sales partner**

*Technical Founder:*
- Idea: 10% (originated)
- Execution: 35% (full-time from day 1)
- Capital: 10% ($10K invested)
- Risk: 25% (quit job, no runway)
- Expertise: 15% (5 years in tech)
- **Total: 95%**

*Sales Partner:*
- Idea: 0%
- Execution: 25% (full-time after validation)
- Capital: 0%
- Risk: 20% (quit job, has runway)
- Expertise: 25% (10+ years in sales)
- **Total: 70%**

**Adjusted: 60/40 split (not 50/50!)**

**Scenario 2: Two equal co-founders from start**

*Founder A (Tech):*
- Idea: 5% (co-created)
- Execution: 35% (full-time)
- Capital: 20% ($25K)
- Risk: 25% (quit job)
- Expertise: 25% (expert developer)
- **Total: 110% → cap at 100%**

*Founder B (Business):*
- Idea: 5% (co-created)
- Execution: 35% (full-time)
- Capital: 20% ($25K)
- Risk: 25% (quit job)
- Expertise: 25% (expert marketer)
- **Total: 110% → cap at 100%**

**Split: 50/50 (truly equal!)**

## 📜 Vesting & Legal

### Standard Vesting Structure

**4-Year Vesting, 1-Year Cliff:**
- Nothing vests for first year
- 25% vests at 1 year
- Remaining 75% vests monthly (years 2-4)
- If someone leaves early, unvested shares return to company

**Why this matters:**
- Protects against early departures
- Aligns long-term commitment
- Standard for investors (won't fund without it)
- Fair to those who stay

**Example:**
```
Partner gets 30% equity with 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
→ Month 12: 7.5% vests
→ Month 24: 15% vests (total)
→ Month 36: 22.5% vests (total)
→ Month 48: 30% vests (total)

If they leave Month 18: They keep 11.25%, company keeps 18.75%
```

### Operating Agreement Essentials

**Must-haves:**
- [ ] Equity split clearly stated
- [ ] Vesting schedule defined
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Decision-making authority (who decides what?)
- [ ] Tie-breaker mechanism (if 50/50)
- [ ] Buyout provisions (if someone wants out)
- [ ] IP assignment (company owns everything)
- [ ] Non-compete clause (1-2 years)
- [ ] Dispute resolution (mediation/arbitration)

**Get a lawyer:** Use Clerky ($500) or attorney ($1,500-3,000)

## 🧪 Trial Period (Critical!)

### 3-Month Partnership Test

- [ ] Clear and concise?

## 💔 When to Part Ways

### Early-Stage (Before Equity Vesting)

**Clear indicators:**
- Not delivering on commitments
- Communication breakdown
- Values misalignment
- Better opportunity for them (and they're not committed)
- Your needs changed (skill gap different now)

**How to end it:**
- Honest conversation (respect)
- Fair financial settlement (if any money exchanged)
- Clean IP transfer (everything to company)
- Maintain relationship (industry is small)

### Post-Vesting (Someone Wants Out)

**Buyout Structure:**
```
Fair Market Value = (Revenue × 3) / # of shares

Example:
- Company does $100K ARR
- Partner owns 30% = 300K shares (of 1M)
- FMV = ($100K × 3) / 1M shares = $0.30/share
- Buyout = 300K shares × $0.30 = $90K

Payment terms: 12-24 months, no interest
```

**Legal:** Use operating agreement buyout provisions

## 🎓 Final Advice

**From Z.I.N.O.K Reviewer:**

> "The partnership phase was the #1 weakness in the original methodology. Having built 5 companies, the co-founder relationship is often make-or-break. This scorecard addresses that gap."

**From BidDeed.AI Experience:**

> "Solo for 10 years had advantages (speed, clarity) but limits (breadth, scale). The right partner could have accelerated BidDeed 2-3× if found early."

**Golden Rules:**
1. Partnership is like marriage - choose carefully
2. Equity is precious - don't give away cheaply
3. Vesting protects everyone - always use it
4. Trial periods save relationships - invest 3 months
5. Legal clarity prevents drama - spend on lawyer
