- Celery leaves, chopped (to taste)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or avocado oil
- **3 tablespoons almond flour** (KETO SWAP - replaces breadcrumbs)

### Step 1: Make Meatball Mixture
1. In large bowl, combine ground beef, grated onion, parsley, celery, celery leaves
2. Add almond flour, egg, oil, and all spices (salt, baharat, mafrum, black pepper, paprika)
3. Mix gently with hands until just combined (don't overmix - keeps meatballs tender)
4. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes (helps meatballs hold shape)

### Step 2: Form Meatballs
1. Wet hands with cold water
2. Form into 18-20 medium meatballs (about 1.5 inches diameter)
3. **OPTIONAL:** Dip in egg wash, then coat lightly with almond flour or crushed nuts
4. **KETO TIP:** Skip coating entirely - just brush with egg wash for browning

### Step 3: Brown Meatballs
1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Brown meatballs in batches, 2-3 minutes per side (don't cook through - just sear)
3. Remove to plate (they finish cooking in sauce)

### Step 4: Make Sauce
1. In same skillet, add crushed garlic and paprika - sauté 30 seconds
2. Add tomato paste, stir 1 minute
3. Add grated tomatoes, celery pieces, baharat, cinnamon, black pepper, salt
4. Add water/bone broth and chicken soup powder
5. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer

### Step 5: Simmer Meatballs in Sauce
1. Gently place browned meatballs into sauce
2. Cover and simmer 30-35 minutes, stirring occasionally
3. Sauce should reduce and thicken
4. **KETO TIP:** If sauce too thin, simmer uncovered last 10 minutes

### Step 6: Serve

- Garnish with fresh parsley
- Serve with: zucchini noodles, cauliflower rice, or shirataki rice (all keto-friendly)
