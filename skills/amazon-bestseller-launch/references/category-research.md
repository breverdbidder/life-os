# Amazon Category Research Guide

## Category Selection Framework

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Categories

Use Amazon's browse tree to find your book's natural fit:

```
Books → Nonfiction → [Main Topic] → [Subtopic] → [Niche]
```

**Example Path:**
```
Books → Business & Money → Marketing & Sales → Marketing → Direct Marketing
```

### Step 2: Analyze Competition Metrics

For each candidate category, collect:

| Metric | How to Find | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| #1 BSR | Top book's product page | <10,000 |
| #1 Reviews | Top book's review count | <100 |
| Top 10 Avg BSR | Average of top 10 | <50,000 |
| Monthly Sales Est | Use Publisher Rocket | >300 |

### Step 3: Calculate Category Score

```
CATEGORY_SCORE = (Est_Monthly_Sales / Books_in_Category) × (100 / Avg_Top10_Reviews)

SCORE > 500 = Excellent opportunity
SCORE 200-500 = Good opportunity  
SCORE < 200 = High competition
```

### Step 4: Validate with "Sticky" Test

A good category should:
- ✅ Have consistent demand (not seasonal)
- ✅ Show books staying ranked for 6+ months
- ✅ Have audience crossover to your other categories
- ✅ Allow you to legitimately claim relevance
