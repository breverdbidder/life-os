# Frontend Design Skill

Creates bold, distinctive UIs that avoid blue/purple gradient "AI slop" aesthetics.

## When to Use
- Building React components or pages
- Creating landing pages or dashboards  
- Any frontend work needing unique aesthetics
- Improving existing UI designs

## Process

1. **Understand Context**: What problem? Who uses it?
2. **Pick BOLD Aesthetic** (commit fully):
   - Brutally minimal, Maximalist chaos, Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural, Luxury/refined, Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine, Brutalist/raw, Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel, Industrial/utilitarian
3. **Execute with Precision**: Typography, spacing, colors matter

## Core Principles
- ❌ NO blue/purple gradients
- ✅ Commit to chosen aesthetic direction  
- ✅ Production-quality code (not mockups)
- ✅ Meticulous attention to details
- ✅ One-shot quality

## Tech Stack
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Unique color palettes (avoid defaults)
- Typography hierarchy
- Micro-interactions
- Responsive design
- Accessibility

## Example Usage
```
"Use frontend design skill to build auction dashboard - make it brutalist"
"Redesign landing page with frontend design - luxury/refined aesthetic"
```
