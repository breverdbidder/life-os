# Frontend Design

Creates bold, production-quality frontends with exceptional aesthetic attention.

## When to Use
- Building React components/pages
- Creating dashboards or landing pages
- Any frontend work avoiding generic "AI slop"

## Before Coding

Pick ONE bold aesthetic direction:
- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Luxury/refined
- Brutalist/raw
- Industrial/utilitarian

## Core Principles
1. NO blue/purple gradients
2. Commit fully to chosen aesthetic
3. Production-ready code, not mockups
4. Meticulous typography and spacing

## Usage
```
"Use frontend design skill to build auction dashboard"
"Redesign landing page - brutalist aesthetic"
```
