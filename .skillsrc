# Skills Directory Security Configuration
# 
# This file enforces read-only access to skills directories
# Agents can READ and EXECUTE skills but CANNOT MODIFY them
#
# Locked Directories:
# - .claude/skills/* (all user skills)
# - /mnt/skills/public/* (system skills)
# - /mnt/skills/examples/* (example skills)
# - /mnt/skills/user/* (if exists)
#
# Security Rules:
# 1. Agents CANNOT write to, delete, or modify files in locked directories
# 2. Agents CANNOT create new files in locked directories
# 3. Agents CAN read SKILL.md files and execute scripts
# 4. New skills MUST be created in /tmp/ or outputs/ for review
# 5. Only human approval can move skills into locked directories
#
# Enforcement:
# - Pre-flight checks in orchestrator workflows
# - File system permissions in sandbox environments
# - Git branch protection for skills/ directories
